excerpt: 'A distributed control strategy (DCS) is an efﬁcient way to realize power sharing among distributed generators (DGs) and restore the voltage deviation caused by droop control. However, there are several limitations in the traditional strategy of hybrid ac/dc microgrid (MG), such as the heavy communication burden and sensitivity to the working conditions. In this article, a distributed model-free adaptive control strategy (DMFAC) is proposed with an event-triggered (ET) mechanism. A uniﬁed control frame-work of hybrid MG is established and the ET-DMFAC can operate within it to realize multiple control strategies simul-taneously. The dynamic linearization parameters of hybrid MG are estimated online to reﬂect the working condition, and an ET mechanism is designed to reduce the communi-cation burden. The stability of ET-DMFAC is analyzed with the discrete Lyapunov theory and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ET-DMFAC strategy under different operating conditions. The outper-formance of ET-DMFAC is demonstrated by comparing it with many existing DCS of hybrid AC/DC MG.'

Abstract - A distributed control strategy (DCS) is an efﬁcient way to realize power sharing among distributed generators (DGs) and restore the voltage deviation caused by droop control. However, there are several limitations in the traditional strategy of hybrid ac/dc microgrid (MG), such as the heavy communication burden and sensitivity to the working conditions. In this article, a distributed model-free adaptive control strategy (DMFAC) is proposed with an event-triggered (ET) mechanism. A uniﬁed control frame-work of hybrid MG is established and the ET-DMFAC can operate within it to realize multiple control strategies simul-taneously. The dynamic linearization parameters of hybrid MG are estimated online to reﬂect the working condition, and an ET mechanism is designed to reduce the communi-cation burden. The stability of ET-DMFAC is analyzed with the discrete Lyapunov theory and experiments are carried out to verify the effectiveness of the proposed ET-DMFAC strategy under different operating conditions. The outper-formance of ET-DMFAC is demonstrated by comparing it with many existing DCS of hybrid AC/DC MG.

Keywords - distributed control, event-triggered (ET) control, hybrid microgrid, model-free adaptive control (MFAC).
