excerpt: 'In a hybrid AC/DC microgrid (MG), power quality issues arise when an unbalanced load connects to the AC subgrid, which are not confined to the AC subsystem but extend to affect the DC subsystem as well. This paper investigates the potential power quality issues caused by AC imbalance, including DC voltage fluctuation and AC current harmonics. Multiple control objectives are developed, aiming to eliminate DC fluctuation, reduce AC distortion and imbalance, and achieve negative sequence current sharing among distributed generations in the AC subgrid. To realize these control objectives, a two-layer coordinated control strategy is proposed. The first layer involves local interlinking converter (IC) control to improve the power quality of the DC subgrid, while the second layer focuses on distributed unbalance compensation control to improve the power quality of the AC subgrid. Finally, several experiments are conducted to verify the effectiveness of the proposed control strategy.'

Abstract - Distributed secondary control (DSC) is an efficient way to realize power sharing among distributed generators (DGs) and restore the voltage deviation caused by droop control. Traditional DSC strategy of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid (MG) needs multiple communication links between interlinking converter (IC) and DGs, which makes the communication network complex and affects DGâ€™s plug&play capability. In this paper, a communication-saving DSC strategy of hybrid AC/DC MG is proposed. Local communications in both ac-MG and dc-MG plus an intercommunication between them are designed for power reference adjustment. Accurate power sharing among all of the DGs can be realized without communicating with IC. A small-signal model of the hybrid system is established for stability analysis and the range of control parameters can be adjusted based on this model. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the proposed DSC strategy under different operating conditions.

Keywords - Communication-saving, distributed secondary control (DSC), hybrid AC/DC microgrid, small-signal analysis.
