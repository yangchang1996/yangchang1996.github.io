excerpt: 'Parallel interlinking converters (ICs) find application in high-power hybrid AC/DC microgrids. However, challenges exist in achieving coordinated control among different ICs for power sharing, which is beyond this parallel structure and encompasses the interplay between different subgrids. The existing approach suffers from a heavy communication burden and sensitivity to disturbances. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distributed robust sliding-mode control (SMC) for the hybrid AC/DC microgrid with parallel ICs, ensuring the convergence of multiple control objectives within a predetermined time slot. An observer is designed to mitigate disturbances for a reduction in the required controller gain and suppression of chattering issues. The stability of the proposed control strategy is analyzed using the Lyapunov theory and control parameters are designed based on the stability analysis. Experiments under various working conditions demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed method compared to traditional distributed control approaches.'

Abstract - Distributed secondary control (DSC) is an efficient way to realize power sharing among distributed generators (DGs) and restore the voltage deviation caused by droop control. Traditional DSC strategy of a hybrid AC/DC microgrid (MG) needs multiple communication links between interlinking converter (IC) and DGs, which makes the communication network complex and affects DGâ€™s plug&play capability. In this paper, a communication-saving DSC strategy of hybrid AC/DC MG is proposed. Local communications in both ac-MG and dc-MG plus an intercommunication between them are designed for power reference adjustment. Accurate power sharing among all of the DGs can be realized without communicating with IC. A small-signal model of the hybrid system is established for stability analysis and the range of control parameters can be adjusted based on this model. Experiments are carried out to demonstrate the proposed DSC strategy under different operating conditions.

Keywords - Communication-saving, distributed secondary control (DSC), hybrid AC/DC microgrid, small-signal analysis.
