Abstract - Parallel interlinking converters (ICs) find application in high-power hybrid AC/DC microgrids. However, challenges exist in achieving coordinated control among different ICs for power sharing, which is beyond this parallel structure and encompasses the interplay between different subgrids. The existing approach suffers from a heavy communication burden and sensitivity to disturbances. To address this issue, this paper proposes a distributed robust sliding-mode control (SMC) for the hybrid AC/DC microgrid with parallel ICs, ensuring the convergence of multiple control objectives within a predetermined time slot. An observer is designed to mitigate disturbances for a reduction in the required controller gain and suppression of chattering issues. The stability of the proposed control strategy is analyzed using the Lyapunov theory and control parameters are designed based on the stability analysis. Experiments under various working conditions demonstrate the outperformance of the proposed method compared to traditional distributed control approaches.
